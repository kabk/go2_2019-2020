These are code examples used during the coding class lead by James Bryan Graves

## content

The markdown content for the website [kabk.hacker.coffee](kabk.hacker.coffee).  This content includes references from lectures, assignments, etc..

## go2bot

This is nodejs IRC bot designed to be run in a UNIX pipe scenario.  Additional README.md in folder.

## 10000.js

This is an example of how to create 10000 (not so unique 😁) files with nodejs and external (typically terminal command, `touch` in this case).

## index.js

`index.js` file from the `/myapp` nodejs server example used in class.  A take on the bare minimum expressjs "Hello world" example, this also includes an example of a link to another path `/` -> `/foo`, and demonstrates how one could, if desired, include a `10000.js` into a server context.

## vote.js

This is an example of a node js express server which tracks votes for a new "bee hive location" in the KABK.
