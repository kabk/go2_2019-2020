## 10000.js

This is an example of how to create 10000 (not so unique 😁) files with nodejs and external (typically terminal command, `touch` in this case).

## index.js

`index.js` file from the myapp nodejs server example.  A take on the bare minimum expressjs "Hello world" fexample, this also includes a link to another path `/` -> `/foo`, and demonstrates how one could, if desired, include `10000.js` into a server context.
