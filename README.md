# Graphic Design 2rd year, 2019 - 2020, Code Examples

These are code examples used during the coding class lead by James Bryan Graves

## go2bot

This is nodejs IRC bot designed to be run in a UNIX pipe scenario.  Additional README.md in folder.

## 10000.js

This is an example of how to create 10000 (not so unique 😁) files with nodejs and external (typically terminal command, `touch` in this case).

## index.js

`index.js` file from the `/myapp` nodejs server example used in class.  A take on the bare minimum expressjs "Hello world" example, this also includes an example of a link to another path `/` -> `/foo`, and demonstrates how one could, if desired, include a `10000.js` into a server context.
