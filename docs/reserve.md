# The Server (revisited)  

The server created during the first semester was never intended to have a strong client and asthetic design.  This is the moment to build out that piece.  Concepts should be further elborated and companied by a client side component.  The minimumal HTML/CSS (if any) hardcoded into the server should be moved to an appropriate software architectual layer.
