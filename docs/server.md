## Assignment

Create your own nodejs HTTP server.  The server should represent a biography of itself and/or it author.  Consider the context place and time of the server creation, and the topology of the internet in which it lives.

### Practical suggestions

Don't be busy with HTML.  Rather consider how to use the server itself in interesting ways to tell the story.

* Every path or link is part of a nonlinear story, or game, `/foo`, `/bar`, etc.?

* Every visitor is connected in some way, via the content they get?

* The server treats visitors in some sort "class" hierarchy based on path/folder, ip, or something else?

* Whatever you can image.
