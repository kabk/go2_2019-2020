# Publish & Destroy (Big Data Edition)

## The Goal

To create no less than 10.000 unqiue media documents (images, text, video or audio) for publication.  The documents should exist only for a fixed amount of time before they are systematically destroyed.

## The Tools

Projects should use the Terminal (Unix style pipes) for media creation, and ultimately subsequent destruction.  Programs/commands in the pipeline can be existing open source projects, or custom Javascript (Node.js) programs.
